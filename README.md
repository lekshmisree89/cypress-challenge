# Cypress testing Suite




## Description
This project contains end-to-end tests for the application using Cypress. Cypress is a powerful, easy-to-use testing framework for front-end testing, allowing us to test user interactions, API responses, and more in an efficient and reliable way.

### Getting Started

 **Prerequisites**
 
*-- Node.js (v14 or later recommended) --*

*-- Cypress (v10 or later)--*

**Make sure Node.js is installed by running**

```
node -v
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone  CYPRESS-CHALLENGE
cd CYPRESS-CHALLENGE

```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
npm install cypress
```

### Project Structure

Cypress test files are typically organized under the cypress/ directory:

cypress/e2e/: Contains all end-to-end (e2e) test files.

cypress/fixtures/: Holds static data or mock data used in tests.

cypress/support/: Contains custom commands and setup files.


### Writing Tests
Basic Example
Hereâ€™s an example of a simple Cypress test to check that the homepage loads correctly:

javascript

```
describe('Homepage', () => {
  it('should load successfully', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.contains('Welcome'); // Example assertion
  });
});
```

### Network Requests

To wait for a network request, set up an alias and use cy.wait():

javascript
```
cy.intercept('GET', '/api/questions').as('getQuestions');
cy.wait('@getQuestions');
```

### Delays

To add a fixed delay, use cy.wait() with a duration in milliseconds:

javascript
```
cy.wait(1000); // Waits for 1 second

```

### Running Tests

#### Open Cypress Test Runner

#### To open the interactive Cypress test runner, use:

```

Copy code
npx cypress open
```

-- This opens the Cypress dashboard, where you can run tests in an interactive browser environment.
